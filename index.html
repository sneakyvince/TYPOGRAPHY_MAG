                    <p>Helvetica or Neue Haas Grotesk is a widely used sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface
                        designer Max Miedinger with input from Eduard Hoffmann. Helvetica is a neo-grotesque or realist design,
                        one influenced by the famous 19th century typeface Akzidenz-Grotesk and other German and Swiss designs.
                        Its use became a hallmark of the International Typographic Style that emerged from the work of Swiss
                        designers in the 1950s and 60s.</p>

                    Max Miedinger (24 December 1910 in Zurich, Switzerland – 8 March 1980, Zürich, Switzerland) was a Swiss typeface designer.
                    He was famous for creating the Neue Haas Grotesk typeface in 1957 that was renamed Helvetica in 1960.
                    Marketed as a symbol of cutting-edge Swiss technology, Helvetica achieved immediate global success. Between
                    1926 and 1930 Miedinger trained as a typesetter in Zürich, after which he attended evening classes at
                    the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich. At age sixteen Max became an apprentice typesetter for Jacques Bollmann
                    at a book printing office in Zürich. After four years as an apprentice, Miedinger enrolled in the School
                    of Arts and Crafts.</p>

                    <p>Bodoni is the name given to the serif typefaces first designed by Giambattista Bodoni (1740–1813) in
                        the late eighteenth century and frequently revived since. Bodoni's typefaces are classified as Didone
                        or modern. Bodoni followed the ideas of John Baskerville, as found in the printing type Baskerville—increased
                        stroke contrast reflecting developing printing technology and a more vertical axis—but he took them
                        to a more extreme conclusion.</p>

                    <p>Rockwell is a slab serif typeface designed by the Monotype Corporation and released in 1934. The project
                        was supervised by Monotype's engineering manager Frank Hinman Pierpont. A serif at the apex of uppercase
                        A is distinct. The lowercase a is two-storey. Because of its monoweighted stroke, Rockwell is used
                        primarily for display or small-size use rather than lengthy bodies of body text. Rockwell is based
                        on an earlier, more condensed slab serif design called Litho Antique.</p>

                    <p>Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, based on a Roman type
                        by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and
                        bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus
                        Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to the original, a contrast to the more aggressive ITC Garamond.</p>

                    <p>Noto is a font family comprising over a hundred individual fonts, which are together designed to cover
                        all the scripts encoded in the Unicode standard. In total Noto fonts cover nearly 64,000 characters,
                        which is under half of the 136,755 characters defined in Unicode 10.0 (released in June 2017). Commissioned
                        by Google, the font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License. Until September 2015, the fonts
                        were under the Apache License 2.0.</p>
